## Minimum Spanning Tree

- [Upper Level](README.md)

#### Definition

> A minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph G is a tree formed from graph edges that connects all the vertices of G at lowest total cost. A minimum spanning three exists if and only if G is connected.

#### Prim's Algorithm

Refer to "Data Structures and Algorithms Analysis in C++ 4th Edition" by Mark Allen Weiss, Chapter 9.5.1.

The running time of the algorithm is O(\|E\|log\|V\|) with binary heaps.

#### Kruskal's Algorithm

Refer to "Data Structures and Algorithms Analysis in C++ 4th Edition" by Mark Allen Weiss, Chapter 9.5.2.

The running time of the algorithm is O(\|E\|log\|V\|).
