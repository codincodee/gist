## Book Review: Introduction to Algorithms - Divide and Conquer

- [Upper Level](README.md)

Refer to "Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition", by Thomas H. Cormen, Chapter 4, "Divide-and-Conquer"

#### Three Steps Recursion

- Divide
- Conquer
- Combine

#### Two Case Studies

- The Maximum-Subarray Problem
  - Running time: Θ(nlgn)
- Matrix Multiplication
  - Simple Approach: Θ(n<sup>3</sup>) vs. Strassen's Method: Θ(n<sup>lg7</sup>)

#### Three Methods for Calculating Asymptotic Bounds for a D&C Solution

- Substitution Method
  - Guess-and-prove
- Recursion-Tree Method
  - Provide a good guess for the "substitution method"
  - Basis of the "master method"
- Master Method
  - A "cookbook" method
  - Three cases
