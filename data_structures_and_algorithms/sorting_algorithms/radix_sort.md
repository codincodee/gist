- [Upper Level](README.md)

Refer to "Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition", Chapter 8.3, "Radix sort".

#### Summary

- Use a stable sort to do the actual sorting
- Sort digit by digit
- Î˜(d(n+k)), where d is the number of digits, k is the number of possible values of a digit
- When d is constant and k is small, running time approximate to O(n)
