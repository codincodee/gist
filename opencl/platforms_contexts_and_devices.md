## Platforms, Contexts, and Devices

- [Upper Level](README.md)

#### Platform

> The first step of an OpenCL application is to query the set of OpenCL platforms and choose one or more of them to use in the application. Associated with a platform is a profile, which describes the capabilities of the particular OpenCL version supported.

#### Devices

> Associated with each platform is a set of compute devices that an application uses to execute code.

#### Contexts

> Contexts provide a container for associated devices, memory objects and command-queues. It is the context that drives communication with, and between, specific devices, and OpenCL defines its memory model in terms of these.
