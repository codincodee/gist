## Programs and Kernels

- [Upper Level](README.md)

#### Kernels

> OpenCL applications express the functions that will execute in parallel on a device as kernels.

#### Kernel Object

> In order to be able to pass arguments to a kernel function, an application must create a kernel object. Kernel objects can be operated on using API functions that allow for setting the kernel arguments and querying the kernel for information.

#### Program Object

> Kernel Objects are created from program objects.
