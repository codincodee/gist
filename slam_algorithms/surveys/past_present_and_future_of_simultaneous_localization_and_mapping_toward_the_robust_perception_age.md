## Past, Present, and Future of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping: Toward the Robust-Perception Age

- [Upper Level](README.md)

Source [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05830.pdf)

#### Summary

- present the "de-facto" standard formulation of for SLAM
- review robustness and scalability in long-term mapping
- review metric and sematic representations for mapping
- review theoretical performance guarantees
- review active SLAM and exploration
- answer two questions: "Do robots need SLAM", "Is SLAM solved"

The paper focuses on metric and sematic SLAM. For topological and vision SLAM, refer to the survey "Visual place recognition: A survey " [PDF](http://www.cvlibs.net/projects/autonomous_vision_survey/literature/Lowry2016TR.pdf).

#### Terminologies

- priori: the location of a set of landmarks (beacons, GPS)

#### Ages of SLAM History

- classical age
  - 1986 - 2004, 
  - the introduction of the main probabilistic formulations for SLAM
  - approaches based on extended Kalman Filters, Particle Filters and maximum likelihood estimation
- algorithmic-analysis age
  - 2014 - 2015
  - studied the observability, convergence, and consistency of SLAM

#### Manifold Aspects that SLAM Involved

- front-end: computer vision, signal-processing
- back-end: geometry, graph theory, optimization, and probabilistic estimation
